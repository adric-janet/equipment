# This takes the list of files to download from a configuration file, which is
# generated from the data at hub.data.ac.uk

# First of all we download each data document and convert it to RDF and cache that.
# If there's a problem, we don't over-ride the previous cache.

# Then we process the cache files to produce a searchable website, and tabular data.
