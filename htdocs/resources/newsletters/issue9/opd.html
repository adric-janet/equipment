<h3>Extending the Organisation Profile Document (OPD) to cover Research Data Management (RDM)</h3>
<img src="/resources/newsletters/issue9/dcc.png" width="175">
<p>By extending the “Linking you” data profile this project aims to exploit the Organisation Profile Document (OPD) and explore the potential to allow HEIs to be transparent by making the RDM infrastructure and policies they have put in place more discoverable – particularly with respect to EPSRC compliance.

<p>During the first phase of this Jisc Research Data Spring pilot a list of 15 RDM components were compiled with input from the international RDM community.  These components were identified as being the minimum set that would be needed to ensure compliance with EPSRC’s Policy Framework on Research Data is feasible. It should be noted that the components need not be developed and delivered in house. In many cases HEIs are looking to third party services providers to deliver aspects of their RDM infrastructure.</p>
<p>The additional components will be included on participating institutions’ current “Linking you” dataset as part of their OPD and will be discovered and displayed automatically using the infrastructure developed as part of the equipment.data service. Improved visibility will enable institutional support staff to more easily signpost the RDM infrastructure that is in place to help researchers meet funders’ requirements as well as enabling HEIs to be more transparent to funders and external partners. </p>


<p>A simple guide is been developed by the Digital Curation Centre explaining the required fields and how to make them discoverable <a href="http://www.dcc.ac.uk/projects/opd-for-rdm/" title="Extending the OPD to cover RDM | Digital Curation Centre">DCC's Website</a>. It is the intention of the project team, led by Joy Davidson, DCC, to initially pilot discovery of these components with 4-5 institutions with a view to establishing a more detailed 3rd phase subject to the outcome of this pilot. </p>
