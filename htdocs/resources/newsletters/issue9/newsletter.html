<p>Welcome to the October 2015 edition of our e-newsletter. Thank you for signing up to receive our news and stay up to date with the latest equipment.data developments. In this issue we are launching our new “How to” guides. These explain the workflow and tools making contribution easy, and all you need to know about the <a href="http://opd.data.ac.uk" title="Organisation Profile Documents">Organisation Profile Document (OPD)</a>, along with discussing in more detail best practice workflows delivering efficiency and wider benefits of your OPD.
</p>
<p>We are currently working with the Digital Curation Centre on a project exploring the extension of the OPD to cover Research Data Management (RDM). For more information see the article below.     
Please get in touch with any comments, suggested stories or feedback.
</p>
<p>Many thanks,<br/>

			<p><strong><a href="http://equipment.data.ac.uk/guides">Making publishing your data easy – Our new step by step guides</a></strong></p>
			<p>
				Our new guides describe the three easy steps to publishing your data along with explaining the role of the OPD in making your data auto-discoverable. Not only will these guides help you with publishing your research equipment availability, they will also make data describing the wider activity of your institution accessible to new search engines and data services – including the National Centre for Universities and Business’ (NCUB) ‘Intelligent Brokerage Tool’ and Jisc Research Data Discovery Service (RDDS) currently under development.

				By extending the “Linking you” data profile this project aims to exploit the Organisation Profile Document (OPD) and explore the potential to allow HEIs to be transparent by making the RDM infrastructure and policies they have put in place more discoverable – particularly with respect to EPSRC compliance. <a href="/newsletters/issue9/opd">Read more</a>

			<p>
				The EPSRC Capital Equipment survey highlighted the challenges faced by institutions in establishing quality in their equipment asset records.  However it needn’t be that challenging. The obvious phrase of ‘quality in, quality out’ doesn’t necessarily mean you need to establish a new role of equipment database administrator. <a href="/newsletters/issue9/quality">Read more</a>

				With ease of contribution being a major success criteria for equipment.data ,it is unsurprising that most contributors have chosen the easiest route!  You may be surprised to note this method is the humble Excel spreadsheet, either manually completed, or generated by your asset register and published to a webpage.  A whopping 38% use this method of publishing data.  With conversations turning to other datasets, interoperability and simple methods of data sharing will be critical.   Observers would be wise to take lessons from this preference.

				With attendance at major conferences in the past three months we have noted the growing push internationally for the application of linked open data techniques.  With growing challenges within HE for greater data sharing, opportunities are emerging for building on the success of equipment.data.
