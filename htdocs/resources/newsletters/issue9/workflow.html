<h3>Best practice workflow and tools supporting efficiency in equipment process</h3>
<img src="/resources/newsletters/issue9/workflow.jpg" width="175">
<p>With efficiency being a major driver in equipment utilisation it is essential to ensure you have an effective workflow for equipment procurement, collaboration and sharing, and appropriate supporting documentation for legal and procedural aspects. </p>
<p>At the University of Southampton a process guide has been introduced: ‘The research equipment asset lifecycle document’, below. This document provides guidance on the purchasing process and lifecycle of the asset record, through to publishing of the equipment or facility on the institution’s equipment database.   Supporting the decision and contracting process, the N8 consortia has developed the N8 Equipment Sharing Toolkit.  This informative guide covers issues regarding health and safety, training, pricing and charging including VAT, and contracts.  In addition the toolkit provides useful template forms to capture information helping inform the decision process. <a href="http://www.n8research.org.uk/economic-impact/n8-efficiency/equipment-sharing-toolkit/" title="Equipment Sharing Toolkit - N8 Research Partnership">Equipment Sharing Toolkit - N8 Research Partnership</a></p>
<p>To support research facilities and equipment sharing/collaborations there are now new legal templates developed by a working group of the Association of University Legal Practitioners (AULP).  These templates cover issues of access, training requirements, liability and transfer to another institution’s site.  For more information about the templates visit <a href="https://www.arma.ac.uk/resources/brunswick-agreements">ARMA's Brunswick Agreement Web Page</a></p>
