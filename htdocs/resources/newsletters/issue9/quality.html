<h3>Quality in = Quality out</h3>
<img src="/resources/newsletters/issue9/qualityimg.png" width="175">
<p>The EPSRC Capital Equipment survey highlighted the challenges faced by institutions in establishing quality in their equipment asset records.  However it needn’t be that challenging. The obvious phrase of ‘quality in, quality out’ doesn’t necessarily mean you need to establish a new role of equipment database administrator.</p>   
<p>To achieve the best results from a database you need to ensure your data capture is of appropriate quality and, importantly these days, efficient. To deliver an informative output equipment.data only requires four simple fields which can be taken from an asset register, CRIS or equipment database. The rest is taken from your institution’s Organisation Profile Document (OPD) as part of the data auto-discovery process.  This data should be easy to capture, providing your workflow requires quality information in the first instance – which is likely to be your purchasing and/or asset management process.</p>
<p>Our new poster provides more helpful advice on data quality and content - <a href="http://equipment.data.ac.uk/guides#quality" title="Guides and Posters">http://equipment.data.ac.uk/guides#quality</a></p>
<p>In the future this method of data auto-discovery could be extended to other datasets e.g. research outputs, teaching programmes, or expertise profiles.</p>
