<h3>equipment.data on the road</h3>
<img src="/resources/newsletters/issue9/road.png" width="175" style="float:right; padding-left:3px;">

<p>With attendance at major conferences in the past three months we have noted the growing push internationally for the application of linked open data techniques.  With growing challenges within HE for greater data sharing, opportunities are emerging for building on the success of equipment.data.  </p>
<h4>S-Lab Conference 16 -17th September</h4>
 
<ul>
<li>Adrian Cox, our Project Manager, contributed to Steve Butcher’s session on equipment sharing, explaining the role of equipment.data as a national data service and summarising the process for automated data aggregation of UK HE published equipment databases.
</li>
<li>An ‘open discussion’ session on equipment efficiency raised the suggestion of a single equipment data reporting system.  This generated lively discussion given the range and age of systems which might provide data.  There was certainly support for a consensus group to progress discussion informing what data could reasonably be captured to inform utilisation. The breadth of systems and mechanisms would suggest a ‘data profile’ which could support future data reporting requirements, but this is likely to be a long way off.  This would certainly be a potential development that could be supported by a CASRAI working group through Jisc and any data aggregation requirement would sit well alongside the current equipment data capture process.

<h4>RDA 6th Plenary, 23-25th September</h4>
<p>The number of attendees increased again from previous plenary meetings with over 600 attending this plenary in Paris.
</p>
<p>The equipment.data message was well publicised in conference literature and through interest at our stand.  With a big push at the event for improved data discoverability and standards, the success of equipment.data as a national data service received noted interest from international attendees and wider data service providers keen to understand our application of linked open data.

<p>The common emerging theme was clearly metadata profiles and their adoption and application as an enabler to interoperability across datasets. There is an evident fear of re-inventing the wheel – why have twelve standards when we can have a thirteenth? In addition there was a sense of concern around – “do we have sufficient consensus?”, however, there has to be a point when conviction is needed. If we are to achieve data aggregation across repositories and data services we will at first need to see the adoption of standardised metadata emerging.  Developments in the RDA metadata standards catalogue Working Group certainly could play an important role with such adoption - <a href="https://rd-alliance.org/group/metadata-standards-catalog-working-group/case-statement/metadata-standards-catalog-wg-case">RDA Metadata Standards Catalog WG Case Statement</a>
