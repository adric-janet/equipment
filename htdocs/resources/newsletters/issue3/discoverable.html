<h3>Is your data discoverable?</h3>
<img src="/resources/newsletters/issue3/scientist-idea.jpg" width="175">
<p>Equipment.data needs your data to be easily discoverable in order for it to be harvested successfully to the portal; we explain the most efficient way to make this happen. &nbsp;</p>
<p>A key part of the functionality of equipment.data is that it doesn&rsquo;t house the equipment and facilities data from participating institutions; it merely harvests the information from where it already exists on institutions websites. The benefits of this model are numerous; but it does mean institutions have to ensure their data is discoverable in order for it to be included.</p>
<p>So how is that achieved? The easiest and most efficient way is to have an Organisational Profile Document or OPD.</p>
<p>The OPD is a file that informs the reader all about the organisation, for example the proper spelling of the official name (e.g. &lsquo;University of Southampton&rsquo; not &lsquo;Southampton University&rsquo;) contact phone number, email addresses, postal address, physical location, etc. &nbsp;Other than standard information like this, it can also state where you can find datasets about the organisation and for us equipment and facilities datasets.</p>
<p>What is important about this document is that is machine readable, so services like equipment.data can read it and get reliable data from the organisation. It also means organisations themselves are responsible for updating the information as it&rsquo;s on their site, which means that any service reading the OPD will also update its information.</p>
<p>More info on the OPD can be found <a href="http://www.data.ac.uk/share-your-data">http://www.data.ac.uk/share-your-data</a></p>
<p><strong>The next level &ndash; make it auto discoverable</strong></p>
<p>Once the OPD is online we still don&rsquo;t know where it is unless we get informed of its location and manually add it to our index &ndash; this isn&rsquo;t very sustainable.</p>
<p>Therefore we&rsquo;re suggesting the OPD is linked to from a standard location e.g. institutions homepage, meaning equipment.data could then check every .ac.uk homepage looking for this link and automatically ingest the OPD and any dataset referenced.</p>
<p>We understand that the team providing equipment and facilities data for your organisation won&rsquo;t always be working hand-in-glove with the team that run the homepage and main website. If the above methods are impractical for you, drop our admin a line at <a href="mailto:chris@data.ac.uk">andy@data.ac.uk</a>&nbsp;and they will manually register the URL of your profile document.</p>
<p>As added incentive, we&rsquo;ve created a compliance standard system where institutions are awarded gold, silver or bronze based on how compliant they are. Find out more: <a href="http://equipment.data.ac.uk/compliance">http://equipment.data.ac.uk/compliance</a></p>
