<p>Hello and welcome to the third issue of the equipment.data e-newsletter - the first of 2014.  This issue we are looking at how to make your data discoverable, some best practice and efficiency models and we also need your help in collating case studies of equipment and facilities collaborations.</p> 
<p>Please feel free to forward this e-newsletter to any interested colleagues. </p>
<p>Many thanks,<br/>
<strong>The equipment.data team</strong></p>

			<p>
			Following the launch of the RCUK Equipment Guidelines requiring greater sharing and collaboration, which resulted in the launch of the national equipment portal, we would be keen to hear from colleagues across the sector that have experience of collaborating and sharing equipment and facilities.

			Firstly, thank you to all those who have engaged with us so far through the landscape study we’re currently undertaking which aims to understand which HE institutions have an equipment database, identifying needs for development support of databases and establishing evidence of the early impact of the RCUK equipment guidelines. We've been having some interesting conversations and made some noteworthy discoveries.

			<p>
			Earlier this month the <a href="http://www.n8research.org.uk/">N8</a> launched its <a href="http://www.n8research.org.uk/asset-collaboration/n8-est/">Equipment Sharing Toolkit</a> (EST). Aimed at addressing operational issues that can arise when university research equipment is shared, the toolkit comprises a set of guiding principles and templates covering four key areas: health and safety, pricing and charging, contracts and legal and VAT.
