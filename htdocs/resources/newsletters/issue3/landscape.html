<h3>The landscape is becoming clear</h3>

<p>Firstly, thank you to all those who have engaged with us so far through the landscape study we’re currently undertaking which aims to understand which HE institutions have an equipment database, identifying needs for development support of databases and establishing evidence of the early impact of the RCUK equipment guidelines.</p>
<p>In addition to the Regional Consortia members we are working with (SES, GW4, M5 and N8), we are now in discussion with a further 32 institutions who are keen to engage with the project, either using the database and/or contributing, and in addition we are in early conversation with a number more who are keen to understand how they might become involved and discuss how the equipment agenda affects them.</p>
<p>Some interesting conversations with colleagues in the west has established that data for many Welsh institution’s research equipment is already collated in a document produced by Higher Education Wales – we are working with HEW to hopefully enable them to share this information with the national portal. </p>
<p>With different funding sources for research equipment and facilities including, RCUK , charities, institutional and private investment there is a range of different reasons behind the motivation for increased visibility, from simply meeting the needs of the equipment guidelines to business incentives such as increased enterprise activity. equipment.data presents a very easy way to make your equipment (database) discoverable to a wide ranging audience.</p>
<p>If you haven’t yet been contacted and would like to participate in the study please contact the coordinator <a href="mailto:feedback@data.ac.uk">Bryony Kirkpatrick.</a></p>
