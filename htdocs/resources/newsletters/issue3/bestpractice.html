<h3>Generating efficiencies and promoting best practice</h3>

<p>When recognising and promoting best practice in generating efficiencies, what questions do we need to ask? Equipment.data project manager Adrian Cox has identified some interesting ways efficiencies could be thought about and encouraged.</p>
<p>A key message stemming from the Wakeham Review focused on the need to generate greater efficiency from our scientific investment. This can range from establishing systems for increasing utilisation, exploring scales of economy in procurement or support agreements, to more innovative ideas such as open publishing of outputs from your equipment enabling others to benefit from timely use of selected results from your research.</p>
<p>The challenge of accessibility doesn&rsquo;t have to compromise opportunities to generate efficiencies.&nbsp; As equipment capability increases and level of output, institutions could consider sharing excess data outputs from equipment, for example through the creation of storage facilities for images or data generated through research which others in the community can access e.g. a researcher requires 200 images of a specimen and his imaging equipment generates 20,000 so chooses to post the most appropriate remainder to the store for the community to utilise in their research.&nbsp; This doesn&rsquo;t compromise the researchers work although could provide efficiencies for the wider community.&nbsp; Research data management policy at many institutions asks researchers to consider and reflect on what data could be published as end of life outputs, although it may not be unreasonable to consider such questions sooner i.e. could your research outputs be shared at point of generation?&nbsp; If so which elements? How will the most significant data be selected? Where will you publish them and how will they be made accessible?</p>
<p>Although we tend to badge requirements under the Equipment Guidelines as &lsquo;equipment sharing&rsquo; there are many questions we should consider aside the simple physical sharing of equipment.&nbsp; This example demonstrates a range of efficiencies can potentially be achieved if demonstrated to have a practical application.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generating efficiencies in the use of equipment isn&rsquo;t just about increasing bookings, it requires much wider thinking in changing the culture of how we access and use equipment, from our data management planning to enabling knowledge retention and development associated with equipment.</p>
