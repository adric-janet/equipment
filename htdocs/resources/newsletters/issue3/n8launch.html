<p>Earlier this month the <a href="http://www.n8research.org.uk/">N8</a> launched its <a href="http://www.n8research.org.uk/asset-collaboration/n8-est/">Equipment Sharing Toolkit</a> (EST). Aimed at addressing operational issues that can arise when university research equipment is shared, the toolkit comprises a set of guiding principles and templates covering four key areas: health and safety, pricing and charging, contracts and legal and VAT.</p>
<p>The toolkit has been designed to be flexible &ndash; it provides templates which can be used together or in isolation to create a bespoke agreement covering the various aspects of sharing of equipment both within a single university and between institutions. The guidance will be updated regularly.</p>
