<h3>Equipment.data needs your stories!</h3>
<img src="/resources/newsletters/issue3/speech.jpg" width="175" alt="Speech">
<p>Following the launch of the RCUK Equipment Guidelines requiring greater sharing and collaboration, which resulted in the launch of the national equipment portal, the team would be keen to hear from colleagues across the sector that have experience of collaborating and sharing equipment and facilities.</p>
<p>Whether itâ€™s been internally, locally within your region or nationally across the UK, they want to hear about your experiences. All feedback would be greatly appreciated and will contribute to EPSRC reporting on the sharing landscape. Please contact <a href="mailto:feedback@data.ac.uk">Louise Payne.</a></p>
