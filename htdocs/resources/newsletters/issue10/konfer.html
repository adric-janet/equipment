<p>
<img src="/resources/newsletters/issue10/konfer.png" width="175">
The National Centre for Universities and Business (NCUB) launched their “intelligent brokerage tool”, Konfer, this month. This intelligent brokerage tool transforms the way university-business collaboration is enabled and maintained. The service applies clever data acquisition techniques along with open data and linked open data aggregations from Gateway to Research (GtR), ORCiD, equipment.data and opd.data.ac.uk to deliver a highly focused higher education data search capability. 
</p>
<p>
Created by NCUB, working in partnership with the <a href="http://www.hefce.ac.uk/" title="Home - Higher Education Funding Council for England">Higher Education Funding Council for England</a> (HEFCE) and <a href="http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/" title="Home - Research Councils UK">Research Councils UK</a> (RCUK), Konfer brings knowledge exchange and growth opportunities to businesses, delivering valuable exposure for university talent, and future prosperity for the UK.
</p>
<p>
When a business spots an opportunity, konfer supports the journey from finding a research partner and funding to planning and co-creation. It does this by giving direct access to:
<ul>
    <li>8000 academics using data from ORCiD </li>
    <li>11,000 facility and equipment listings drawing upon equipment.data data and use of the Organisational Profile Document (OPD) technology via opd.data.ac.uk. </li>
    <li>800,000 web pages from university sites and social media</li>
    <li>22,000 YouTube videos from university channels</li>
    <li>10,000 news, funding and events articles from curated feeds</li>
    <li>50,000 publicly funded research projects</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
