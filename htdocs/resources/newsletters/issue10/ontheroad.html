<p>With attendance at major conferences in the past three months we have noted the growing push internationally for the application of linked open data techniques.  With growing challenges within HE for greater data sharing, opportunities are emerging for building on the success of equipment.data.  </p>

<h4>9th December 2015. Open Access Research Data Conference.</h4>  

<p>Presentation by University of Southampton included summary of use of OPD in making data discoverable, explaining it’s not just equipment and facilities information discovered by equipment.data but a range of other data the OPD can provide to other data discovery tools.  The sessions generated a lot of interest from attendees, many interested in the discovery of the OIA-PMH end points and the increased visibility the OPD could offer.

<h4>3rd March 2016.  Jisc Digifest - Demo session “<a href="https://www.jisc.ac.uk/events/jisc-digital-festival-02-mar-2016/programme">Making the most of your research facilities and equipment: How to use the national equipment portal</a>”.</h4>
<p>Contribution to Jisc led demonstrator session providing a summary of Jisc support for the equipment sharing and efficiency agenda.  The session included an overview of helpful asset workflow reviews, the University of Southampton Asset Management Lifecycle, highlighted in the recent BUFDG article, a summary of the Kit Catalogue Pilot and how the system can support the need to publish equipment to National Equipment Portal, equipment.data. The session ended with a demonstration of equipment.data and how the technology is now contributing to other sector wide search capabilities including the NCUB’s Konfer.

<h4>11-15th April 2016. WWW2016 Conference. </h4>
<p>equipment.data were lucky enough to distribute a poster with the conference pack promoting data autodiscovery highlighting the successful application of linked open data in the delivery of the “National Equipment Portal”.  Alongside this promotion the technology was explained in more detail during the developer track in which equipment.data was well received as a major driver in the application of the linked open data techniques.  The application was recognised as an important demonstration of how such techniques alongside open source programming can underpin a “<a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-02/06/tim-berners-lee-reclaim-the-web" title="Tim Berners-Lee: we need to re-decentralise the web (Wired UK)">decentralised web</a>” - a focus of Sir Tim Berners-Lee original design for the web, re-iterated at the conference during his keynote.
