			<p><strong><a href="/newsletters/issue10/jisc">Transfer to Jisc - a new era for equipment.data</a></strong></p>
			<p>Jisc is working with Universities UK, Research Councils UK (RCUK) and the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) to operationalise the sharing of equipment and facilities between institutions and, where appropriate, with industry.  Building on the successful development and launch of equipment.data, we are engaging with EPSRC and the University of Southampton to ensure ongoing support for its delivery as a sustainable national service. <a href="/newsletters/issue10/jisc">Read more</a>

			<p><strong><a href="/newsletters/issue10/epsrc">The outlook from EPSRC</a></strong></p>
			<p>Few people in the HE sector will be unaware of the competitiveness of winning capital investment from the Research Councils; especially since 2011 when the capital budgets of the Research Councils were reduced by about 50%. Following this reduction in capital budget Research Councils UK (RCUK) invested a small amount of money in projects aimed at developing tools that could help institutions and the community deal with this new landscape and increase sharing of equipment, with the ultimate aim of maximising usage. One of these projects was equipment.data at the University of Southampton.

			<p><strong>EPSRC Engineering Instrument Pool</strong></p>
			<p>With the closure of the Engineering Equipment Pool, institutions hosting these items should now be publishing the hosting of the item on their institution equipment database.   The full instrument pool equipment dataset can be found on the equipment.data status page <a href="http://equipment.data.ac.uk/status" title="Status Report">http://equipment.data.ac.uk/status</a> .  </p><p>If your dataset isn’t public see our article “Publishing your data couldn’t be easier” in this newsletter.

			<p><strong><a href="/newsletters/issue10/konfer">The “Intelligent Brokerage Tool” – introducing Konfer</a></strong></p>
			<p>
The National Centre for Universities and Business (NCUB) launched their “intelligent brokerage tool”, Konfer, this month. This intelligent brokerage tool transforms the way university-business collaboration is enabled and maintained. The service applies clever data acquisition techniques along with open data and linked open data aggregations from Gateway to Research (GtR), ORCiD, equipment.data and opd.data.ac.uk to deliver a highly focused higher education data search capability.

				With attendance at major conferences in the past three months we have noted the growing push internationally for the application of linked open data techniques.  With growing challenges within HE for greater data sharing, opportunities are emerging for building on the success of equipment.data.
