<h3>Achieving efficiencies through partnership</h3>
<img src="/resources/newsletters/issue5/conference_thumb.jpg.png" width="175">
<p>We have recently started working with the Advanced Procurement for Universities and Colleges (APUC) to discuss the opportunities and benefits of an Application Programming Interface (API) feature enabling publication of user selected capital items from the EDAM database in the UNIQUIP data publishing specification format.</em>&nbsp; This will enable institutions to point to this feed with their OPD enabling discovery of the selected equipment data by equipment.data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The added benefit for the institution is they will be able to use this API to ingest the data into institutional systems such as their research management information system e.g. Pure or their repository when referencing equipment in publications. We are also exploring opportunities for a joint workshop for APUC institutions covering issues relating to the capital asset lifecycle and recent related data management developments. More details on this will be covered in our next newsletter.</p>
