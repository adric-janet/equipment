<h3>The importance of asset management</h3>

<p>A fundamental challenge that has arisen from the development of equipment databases has been the issues it has raised in asset management resulting in the need for improved and enhanced data along with interoperability with other institutional systems. </em></p>
<p>Vendor engagement has become a critical component in this area with a need to highlight the benefits of asset system functionality in enabling contribution and interoperability with equipment databases, both institutional and external.&nbsp; Adoption of the UNIQUIP data publishing specification in asset systems or related views, along with appropriate APIs, will open up greater opportunities for efficiency in asset management relating to research equipment.&nbsp; It is interesting to note this is becoming an emerging area of interest in the finance community and is now recognised by BUFDG as an important factor as the relationship between asset management and research equipment databases becomes clearer. The scenarios we are seeing all have a common element, the asset management system (e.g. Agresso asset module):</p>
<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asset management system to web</p>
<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asset management system to Research Equipment database (e.g. Kit Catalogue) to Web</p>
<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asset management system to Research information management system (e.g. Pure) to Web</p>
<p>The driver in all scenarios is ensuring accurate information is captured at the procurement stage which then feeds through the asset lifecycle.&nbsp; Use of this data for equipment databases provides the benefit of ownership and a responsibility for quality from the academic community and support staff e.g. descriptions and locations.&nbsp; This ensures accurate information is published through the database.</p>
