<p>Hello and welcome to our fifth issue of the equipment.data e-newsletter.  In this issue Adrian Cox, Project Manager of equipment.data, explores the efficiency benefits of the OPD (Organisational Profile Document) in data discovery as well as how the development of equipment databases has raised the status of institutional asset management.  Thank you for signing up and we hope you find this newsletter useful.  If you would like to contribute or comment on any article please get in touch with us.</p>
<p>Please forward this e-newsletter onto any interested colleagues.</p>
<p>Many thanks,<br/>
