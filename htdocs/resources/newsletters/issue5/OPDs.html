<h3>The OPD - enabling greater efficiency in data discovery</h3>
<img src="/resources/newsletters/issue5/acox_thumb.jpg.png" width="175">
<p>With many organisations now establishing an Organisational Profile Document (OPD) enabling auto-discovery of their equipment data, opportunities for greater efficiency in data discovery is possible.&nbsp; </em></p>
<p>Essentially OPDs have established auto-discovery of institutions (their websites) which in turn will deliver many future benefits for information sharing both publishing requirements e.g. research outputs but also the potential for reporting obligations such as HESA returns and maybe even your research outcomes.&nbsp; Simple things are possible to start with such as linking to academic biographies, institutional RSS feeds, even Data Management Planning Policy.&nbsp; More complex datasets will require an agreed profile &ldquo;standardised vocabulary&rdquo; for the sector. This is something that Jisc are already exploring with the <a href="http://casrai.org/">CASRAI</a> UK pilot project. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The challenge as wider use of OPDs increases will be agreeing ownership of the OPD within your organisation.&nbsp; It may be logical for this to be your marketing and communications department who typically will be responsible for your website (home page) and could therefore manage the OPD content and/or link to the OPD. To date, due to the focus on research equipment data, we have mainly worked with teams from research support offices and IT departments although as more data links are established and OPDs have a wider use ownership could become the responsibility of marketing &amp; communications or IT departments.</p>
