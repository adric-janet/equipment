<p>Thank you for signing up to receive our newsletter.  This is our seventh issue and you can now browse through pervious issues on the homepage of the website. </p>

<p>In this issue we celebrate the recognition of equipment.data in the UUK "Efficiency, effectiveness and value for money" report, which makes key recommendations for the future use of equipment.data in publishing availability of publically funded equipment.  In this issue we also introduce the new search facility on the database which enables people to search just your institution through a personalised web page.  Enjoy this informative spring edition and please take part in the quick survey so that we can continually improve and develop your national equipment portal.
