<h3>Giving something back – your personal institutional search!</h3>
<img src="/resources/newsletters/issue7/logos.png" width="175">
<p>We have been encouraged by the efforts institutions have made to contribute to equipment.data and realise for those taking the simplest route of publishing excel spreadsheets, in many cases you don’t have an institutional search capability.  We have therefore set about resolving this by creating a personalised search for your institution.  This will be a link on the “status” page providing a search page carrying your logo a search filterable by your institution, regional consortia if applicable and national. This search feature will also retain the features of the main website including distance from, if searching regionally or nationally and where available image display. <a href="http://equipment.data.ac.uk/status" title="Status Report">Check out the status page to find your institution's search page.</a>
