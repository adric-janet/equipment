<p>The success of the equipment.data national equipment portal has largely been due to the ease of contributing – We therefore owe a big thank you to those making data available. We have seen interest from a range of institutions many taking the simple approach of publishing reports from their asset registers on excel spreadsheets. This simplicity has been a major factor in enabling over 40 institutions to contribute with many more in the process of joining, resulting in over 10,000 items of research equipment now being discoverable.   It is this success which has been noted in the UUK Efficiency, Effectiveness and Value for Money report <a href="http://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/highereducation/Documents/2015/EfficiencyEffectivenessValueForMoney.pdf">http://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/highereducation/Documents/2015/EfficiencyEffectivenessValueForMoney.pdf</a></p>
<p>Acknowledgements include the key recommendation on the portals future use which states “all new equipment using public funding sources and over OJEU threshold should be registered on equipment.data.ac.uk….”.   In the report Sir Ian Diamond also makes the connection with equipment.data’s drive and contribution to the adoption and use of open data “Using a standard open data approach to equipment data made it easier for institutions to contribute to the UK national equipment sharing database”, page 68.</p>
<p>Contributing now couldn’t be easier with many developments now emerging through wider institutional system enhancements reducing the need for duplication of data entry in separate databases.  In particular many of the Current Research Information Systems (CRIS) offer equipment modules and with an active user group Pure is advancing the use of their equipment module. </p>
<p>The development is now moving into a new phase, jointly funded by EPSRC and Jisc from 1st April 2015, and will be considering the potential positioning as a Jisc service along with the wider data discovery benefits presented by tools such as the Organisation Profile Document (OPD).
