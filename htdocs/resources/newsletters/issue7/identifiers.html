<h3>Persistent identifiers</h3>
<img src="/resources/newsletters/issue7/gift_tag.jpg" width="175">
<p>Persistent identifiers are a critical component for the development of robust linked open data as they are in research data management.  Whilst not joining in the argument between URIs and DOIs this article instead focuses on the need for a quality source for the ID informing them.  In the case of research equipment we are very lucky, we should all be allocating asset IDs in our asset registers and by their very nature they should be persistent, never duplicated or re-used.  Using asset IDs will provide a very reliable unique ID creating the relationship between your financial records, institutional equipment register and equipment.data, who will resolve this ID into an equipment.data URI, which can be downloaded and used in your institutional systems should you wish. Having these relationships and resilience of a unique ID will provide confidence in the re-use of the URI in other systems e.g. in referencing equipment in research outputs.
</p>
<p>It is our aim to encourage adoption of persistent identifiers (unique IDs) allowing the equipment.data system to generate reliable URIs. This would allow the national dataset to be combined with other datasets unlocking the real power of linked data.
</p>
<p>Persistent identifiers are being encouraged in many other areas of data management e.g. the adoption of <a href="http://orcid.org" title="ORCID | Connecting Research and Researchers">ORCID</a> and institutional identifiers e.g. <a href="http://isni.org" title="ISNI">ISNI</a>. Such IDs will allow the development of comprehensive linked data datasets such as the Gateway to Research website or aggregations bringing in other datasets e.g. a business facing portal enabling complex searching of expertise and capability data from across HE, filtered by academic or equipment with related grant or publication information â€“ only possibly with persistent identifiers.
