<h3>Benefits of "gold"</h3>
<img src="/resources/newsletters/issue7/scientist-idea.jpg" width="175">
<p>By upgrading to the “Gold” standard i.e. enabling full autodiscovery, you are establishing resilience in the data provision and removing the need for manual intervention if changing the location of your data or adding a new dataset.   By including the link in your home page header and ensuring it forms part of the page structure (i.e. will be retained in website refreshes) you are ensuring your institutions OPD remains discoverable and the information it contains up to date.</p>
<p>With many contributors ensuring they have an auto-discoverable OPD there is a feeling the infrastructure could grow and 5-10 years from now this could deliver wider improved efficiency in HE data management planning.</p>
<p>The project team are already exploring research outputs discovery with DCC (<a href="http://www.dcc.ac.uk/projects/research-data-registry-pilot" title="Jisc Research Data Registry and Discovery Service | Digital Curation Centre">http://www.dcc.ac.uk/projects/research-data-registry-pilot</a>)  It is easy to get involved, just add your OAI-PMH end point to your OPD as the Archaeology Data Service <a href="http://opd.data.ac.uk/org/34689817711a50a7b80ea71763cc3e02/archaeology_data_service.html">http://opd.data.ac.uk/org/34689817711a50a7b80ea71763cc3e02/archaeology_data_service.html</a></p>
<p>For those that wish to add their own research output repositories to their OPD, all they need to do is add another dataset section to their profile, more info: <a href="http://opd.data.ac.uk/docs/datasets" title="Documentation: Datasets">http://opd.data.ac.uk/docs/datasets </a>
We are also about to kick off a project with the DCC to explore the potential to use the OPD in Research Data Management (RDM).  This project will explore the value in reporting items such as the availability of an institution’s Ethics Policy, Research Governance, Data Management Planning Strategy, etc. It is hoped by making these items autodiscoverable manual reporting/checking can be reduced.
