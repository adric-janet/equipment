<p>Hello and welcome to the new-look fourth issue of the equipment.data e-newsletter.  This issue we have some interesting thought pieces, including an article discussing the real efficiencies of sharing data from Adrian Cox, equipment.data and we also have David Baker, Executive Director from Casrai and Adrian looking at the future vision for data profiles.</p>
<p>Please feel free to forward this e-newsletter to any interested colleagues.</p>
<p>Many thanks,<br/>

			<p><strong><a href="/newsletters/issue4/efficiencies">What are the real efficiencies from sharing equipment?</a></strong></p>
			<p>If sharing is largely collaborating then are we collaborating as much as we can? Or are we focussed on the need to collaborate more when actually such activity is fully optimised?</p>
			<p>Therefore is the question we should really be asking ourselves "how can we become more efficient?"</p>

			In the last issue we explained how easy it is to make your data discoverable, and this article explains the gold, silver and bronze compliance ratings we provide to indicate to what level each contributing institution’s data input is sustainable.

			<p><strong>Contribution made easy</strong></p>
			<p>
			Following the success of our poster explaining how to search equipment.data and access equipment, we have created a prequel which sets out how to easily contribute and make your data discoverable. The poster uses clear and simple visuals to explain what is often wrongly perceived as a complicated process, and is downloadable from our website so you can use and share it among colleagues within your institution. We hope you find it useful. </p>

			<p><strong>Tell us your stories</strong></p>
			<p>
			With the equipment.data dataset growing and the collaboration agenda flourishing, we are interested in hearing from individuals, institutions and organisations that have experience of collaborating and sharing equipment and facilities. If you’ve been involved in a collaboration internally within your institution, locally in your region or nationally across the UK, we want to hear about your experiences. All feedback would be greatly appreciated and will contribute to our reports to the EPSRC on the sharing landscape. Please contact <a href="mailto:feedback@data.ac.uk">Victoria Hooper</a>. </p>
