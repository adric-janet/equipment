<p>In the last newsletter we explained how easy it is to make your data discoverable using <a href="http://equipment.data.ac.uk/faq#whatisanopd">OPDs (Oganisational Profile Document)</a>. For the equipment.data project to reach its goal of a fully sustainable system, we need a method of updating sources as efficiently as possible so we use gold, silver and bronze compliance ratings to indicate to what level each contributing institution&rsquo;s data input is sustainable. Changes to data can be as small as an institution altering its logo, to moving its data source from one system to another, but they still need to be captured in an efficient way.&nbsp; The ideal is that all institutions will be operating in the gold compliance rating so that no resource is required from either the contributing institution or the equipment.data project in updating information as it will be automatically picked up by the OPD, as outlined below:&nbsp;</p>
<h3>
	<strong>Bronze</strong></h3>
<p>The very bare minimum for getting your data into equipment.data is to tell us all of your information, e.g. Institution Name, Logo, Dataset urls etc and we will manually maintain this list. This requires resource from the equipment.data project and while we can provide this support in the short term this will not be sustainable in the long term.</p>
<h3>
	<strong>Silver</strong></h3>
<p>A better way for an institution to contribute all of its details is to provide a document that lists all of the required information. This is the OPD and contains the organisation&#39;s full name, homepage, logo, dataset location and contact information for the equipment dataset.</p>
<p>Having this document means that if the institution wants to change its dataset location all they would have to do is update their Profile Document and this will automatically update the equipment.data records. The only manual input required from the project is we need to add the location of a new institution&rsquo;s OPD, but the work load is significantly lower than the Bronze method.</p>
<h3>
	<strong>Gold</strong></h3>
<p>To allow new institutions datasets to become auto discovered we use a way of discovering OPDs automatically. This is done by placing a link to the OPD somewhere on the institutions home page (it is not a visible link and is hidden in the header). Our system then checks every .ac.uk webpage looking for the link to the OPD and then ingesting any linked datasets. This allows new datasets to be added <strong>with no manual input </strong>from the project required and therefore making the future of equipment.data highly sustainable.</p>
