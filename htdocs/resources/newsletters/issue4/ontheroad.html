<h3>equipment.data on the road!</h3>
<img src="/resources/newsletters/issue4/Digifest14_thumb.jpg.png" width="175">
<p>We have been busy attending a range of high profile and informative events across the UK and Europe over the last few months to join up with initiatives and share the momentum and developments of equipment.data.</p>
<p>30th April, <a href="http://www.effectivelab.org.uk">S-LAB Effective Use of Laboratory Equipment and Resources: Inventory and Booking Systems Workshop</a>, London</p>
<p>This workshop focussed on the growing realisation of the potential to make better use of laboratory equipment, resources and space.&nbsp; Adrian Cox presented a paper on &ldquo;The Challenges of Developing Standards&rdquo; introducing the equipment.data project and the technology behind data aggregation. The day aimed to promote and support facilities management and explore the interaction of &lsquo;bottom up systems&rsquo; with the higher level schemes developed by consortia and funders, and to discuss whether the approaches are likely to converge, or remain separate, and what measures can be taken to ensure that they work well together.&nbsp;</p>
<p>16th May, <a href="http://reconnect.casrai.org">CASRAI Europe ReConnect 2014</a>, Rome</p>
<p>ReConnect is CASRAI&#39;s annual conference that brings together the policy and technology experts to share, network and learn the best practices required to advance community-driven data standards for efficient and effective management of research and innovation operations. We would like to extend a big thank you to CASRAI for the opportunity as event sponsor and displaying at the conference. The event was a great opportunity to meet new stakeholders from across Europe and to showcase how we use the data &ldquo;profile&rdquo; in our data aggregation service.</p>
<p>19th May, <a href="http://www.epsrc.ac.uk">EPSRC SATs Conference</a>, Birmingham</p>
<p>Presenting to the EPSRC Strategic Advisory Teams at their annual conference gave equipment.data an opportunity to highlight, to an influential audience of peers in the sector, the importance of the project and objective to enable efficient research equipment discovery and sharing through a sustainable national search function.&nbsp; There was a feeling amongst members of the audience this could be a powerful data set and the real potential could be in its future application.</p>
<p>20-21st May, PURE User Group UK, University of Aberystwyth</p>
<p>An equipment sharing focussed session at this workshop provided a great opportunity to introduce PURE user universities to the equipment.data project and to discuss the application of PURE equipment module within institutions management information processes and to identify what enhancements to functionality could be considered to improve utilisation of the module.&nbsp;</p>
<p>6th June, <a href="http://casrai.org">CASRAI UK</a> National Standards Committee meeting, London</p>
<p>CASRAI, the standards development organisation have a UK National Standards Committee which governs and oversee successive and scheduled iterations of a portfolio of UK data standards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The meeting highlighted some of the key challenges faced by the community in creating an infrastructure for data sharing. Panel discussion focussed on the need for authoritative lists for institutional identifiers e.g. UKPRN for HE Institutions, FunderID for funding organisations along with need to agree use cases for the establishing of profiles e.g. the UNIQUIP data publishing specification a profile for research equipment.&nbsp; The success of this meeting was attributed to the informal layout with attendees coining the phrase the &ldquo;CASRAI cafe&rdquo;. The atmosphere generated valuable engagement and a clear appetite for the meeting becoming a strategic recurring event, either annually or more frequently.</p>
<p>10th June, Annual <a href="https://www.arma.ac.uk">ARMA</a> conference, Blackpool</p>
<p>Thanks to all those who came to see us at this key annual conference.&nbsp; At a critical stage in the project it was useful to chat to those keen to understand how they can engage and for the project team to chat to research data management (RDM) system vendors about API and standards adoption and integrating the equipment profile.&nbsp; It was also a great opportunity to meet with institutions that have contributed to the landscape study we recently carried out providing a national picture of HE institution research equipment databases and impact of equipment sharing agenda.</p>
<p>16th June, <a href="http://www.dcc.ac.uk/events/workshops/jisc-research-data-registry-and-discovery-service-june-workshop">JISC Research Data Registry and Discovery Service</a>: June Workshop, London</p>
<p>JISC, through the DCC (Digital Curation Centre), is developing a national service to help make UK research data more discoverable and more likely to be reused. This DCC pilot ultimately aims to provide a coherent point of access to discoverable, searchable, browsable and actionable descriptions of given datasets and how to access them, and so showcase the wealth of UK research data.&nbsp; equipment.data was able to share our approach and exchange ideas with the project team gaining some useful insights and potential &nbsp;linkages for the project.</p>
<p>The next series of events equipment.data will be involved in start in the autumn so we will keep you updated in the autumn newsletter.</p>
