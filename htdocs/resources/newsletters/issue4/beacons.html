<h3>“Buttons to Beacons”</h3>
<img src="/resources/newsletters/issue4/image3.jpg" width="175">
<p>David Baker, Executive Director at Casrai and Adrian Cox, Project Manager for equipment.data, have come together to share their thoughts on bridging the gaps between data sets and a vision for the future.</em></p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Buttons to Beacons&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>We work in a research management world that is, by definition, distributed. We work across multiple organisations, disciplines and indeed nations. We must move information from stakeholder to stakeholder in order to get even the most basic work done. Often what we need to know is not sitting in the databases we manage but is spread across many databases outside of our immediate control. To bridge these gaps we need simple &#39;connectors&#39; that we can all agree on. We cannot just keep building more and more bilateral maps between any two databases we want to connect.</p>
<p>Through many initiatives across the world progress is being made on reaching agreement on metadata for the exchanges we need to make. Within the UK HE sector there are a range of such initiatives including the <a href="http://equipment.data.ac.uk/">equipment.data</a> project itself, <a href="http://www.hediip.ac.uk/">HEDIIP</a> and <a href="http://www.dcc.ac.uk/">DCC&rsquo;s</a> UK RDRDS and reaching across these projects the standards initiative, <a href="http://www.casrai.org/">CASRAI</a>, providing a common reference point for evolving agreements and exchangeable files.</p>
<p>However, we now need to be closing the loop and putting actual CASRAI connectors onto our databases. The sector should establish a grand vision with clear goals of making data more discoverable, using tools such as the <a href="http://equipment.data.ac.uk/faq#whatisanopd">OPD</a> or adding open APIs for publishing the data we want to make available - think of these tools as &#39;beacons&#39; across the landscape - sending and receiving data much as humans now traverse the web in a browser.</p>
<p>We needn&#39;t wait for this &#39;nirvana&#39; - while we work towards the beacons of our future we can start by adding simple controls into our data collection web forms and reports, by following developing open standards and tools - call them &#39;buttons&#39; - that remove the need to re-enter data that we already have. When creating or re-using data think about its origin, who manages it or how could it be used. Managing it more effectively and making it more discoverable will not only generate efficiencies in its use but also new opportunities &ndash; it&rsquo;s how equipment.data evolved.</p>
<p>We must aim for the beacons but give ourselves the buttons in the meantime.</p>
