The survey, coordinated in May 2015, used university input to equipment.data as the starting point for university responses on the capital equipment they hold that is primarily used by their engineering researchers. This exercise highlighted the need for improved workflow around data source e.g. quality of asset register data transferred to equipment databases and range of items published e.g. questioning what is sharable?  Value will be a major consideration balancing cost of access with value and availability of a piece of equipment, the recent <a href="http://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/highereducation/Pages/EfficiencyEffectivenessValueForMoney.aspx" title="Universities UK - Efficiency, effectiveness and value for money">Efficiency, effectiveness and value for money report</a> coordinated by the UUK recommends OJEU threshold and above are published on equipment.data. However, the expertise attached to equipment and facilities is also a significant factor and indicating the application and use of the equipment in the description will help inform those searching for particular items of equipment. The survey also asked what institutions are doing to promote improved utilisation and sharing.  For example, do you actively promote your equipment on regional and national search facilities for equipment sharing? The responses indicate there are more organisations that could utilise the power of equipment.data to showcase their equipment.
