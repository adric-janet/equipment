<h3>Jisc Research Data Spring Project “Extending the Organisation Profile Document (OPD) to cover Research Data Management (RDM)”</h3>
<img src="/resources/newsletters/issue8/sharing data.jpg" width="175" style="float:right;">

<p>This project aims to exploit the <a href="http://opd.data.ac.uk/" title="Organisation Profile Documents">Organisation Profile Document (OPD)</a>, developed to make organisational information about research equipment discoverable. As you will already be aware, the OPD is used as part of the auto-discovery infrastructure for the aggregation of equipment datasets for equipment.data and reduces the need for manual intervention in data discovery and aggregation.</p>

<p>The OPD’s basic structure includes just four components:
<ul>
	<li>Organisation URI</li>
	<li>Prefixes</li>
	<li>Document Description</li>
	<li>Organisation Description</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>However, users can also extend their OPD with optional extras about their organisation. Current additional information that can be exposed include locations of equipment;  descriptions of social network accounts used by the organisation;  news and event feeds from the organisation; pointers to key pages in your organisational website; and the ability to link to datasets and/or data catalogues. 
</p>
<p>This project will explore the potential to further extend the OPD to allow HEIs to be transparent about the RDM infrastructure and policies they have put in place – particularly with respect to EPSRC compliance.  A key aim for the project is to expose details of infrastructure and policy emerging as a result of Jisc’s Managing Research Data (MRD) funding programme. The DCC has worked with many of the MRD projects to share details of the work done via the Evidence Gathering support project, through the production of case studies, and contributions to the DCC “Where are they now?” blog series. </p>
<p>However, it is felt that by extending the OPD to include RDM infrastructure information, the work funded by Jisc will have greater visibility leading to greater potential for sharing experiences and ultimately reuse of piloted approaches. 
</p>
<p>As highlighted through the MRD programme, infrastructure depends upon softer elements as well as hardware and software. In this respect, much of the less well known MRD outputs such as tailored support, training and guidance web pages can be made more visible through the use of the OPD. An open approach would make it easier for HEIs to see what their Jisc-funded peers have achieved and make it easier to identify potential regional partnerships and areas where shared services might be feasible. As yet, EPSRC have no plans to monitor compliance over and above “dipstick” testing. However, by producing an OPD including details on RDM infrastructure – both hard and soft - HEIs are effectively self-badging their progress towards compliance. In the event that EPSRC compliance is monitored more rigorously in the future, the extended, auto-discoverable OPD could provide a simple mechanism for this to take place without additional burden on HEIs or the funding body.
