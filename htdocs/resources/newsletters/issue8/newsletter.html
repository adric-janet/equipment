<p>Welcome to the July 2015 edition of our e-newsletter. Thank you for signing up to receive our news and stay up to date with all the latest equipment.data developments. In this issue we are focusing on workflow and making contribution easy by introducing the “How to Contribute” guide as well as looking at using Pure to contribute to equipment.data, we discuss extending the Organisation Profile Document (OPD) to cover Research Data Management (RDM) and address the recent EPSRC Capital Equipment Survey which has highlighted the need for improved workflow around data source.</p>

<p>We would also like to remind those contributing contacts who have yet to upgrade to the “Gold” standard i.e. enabling full autodiscovery, to please do so as soon as possible in order to ensure resilience in the data provision and remove the need for manual intervention if changing the location of your data or adding a new dataset. Please do not hesitate to <a href="mailto:support@data.ac.uk">contact us</a> if contact details have changed or you need assistance in the upgrade process.
</p>

<p>As always, we hope you enjoy this summer issue and please feel welcome to get in touch with us and comment on any article, suggest stories, provide feedback or forward this e-newsletter onto any interested colleagues.</p>

<p>Many thanks,<br/>
<strong>The equipment.data team</strong></p>

			<p><strong><a href="/newsletters/issue8/howtoguide">Contributing to equipment.data – made easy</a></strong></p>
			<p>
				We have now published a simple “How to contribute” guide explaining the components needed to enable contribution to equipment.data. This simple guide highlights workflow considerations and dataset formats including the UNIQUIP Data publishing specification as well as the use of the Organisation Profile Document (OPD) in the autodiscovery process.

			<p><strong><a href="/newsletters/issue8/usingpure">Using Pure to contribute to equipment.data Pure User Group – May 2015</a></strong></p>
			<p>
			At Aberystwyth University they have decided that the definitive list of their equipment is to be held within Pure, a Current Research Information System from Elsevier designed to help institutions manage their Publication, Academic and (most importantly from our point of view) Research Equipment and Facilities information. In the following article we show the workflow used to publish their equipment dataset.

			This Jisc Research Data Spring project aims to exploit the <a href="http://opd.data.ac.uk/" title="Organisation Profile Documents">Organisation Profile Document (OPD)</a> and explore the potential to further extend the OPD to allow HEIs to be transparent about the RDM infrastructure and policies they have put in place – particularly with respect to EPSRC compliance.

			Once again it has been a busy time for the equipment.data team with two very significant events taking place in recent months. The International Open Data Conference and the ARMA Annual Conference both proving to be a huge success, highlighted the excellent work that goes on in all areas of equipment.data and gave us the chance to celebrate and recognise the tremendous commitment and enthusiasm of all those involved.
