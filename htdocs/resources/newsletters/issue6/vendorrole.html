<h3>Enabling efficiencies through linked open data technology - the vendorsâ€™ role</h3>
<img src="/resources/newsletters/issue6/vendor.png" width="175">
<p>For the equipment sharing agenda vendor engagement has become a critical component in delivering effective asset management systems.&nbsp; There is the need to highlight the benefits of asset system functionality that will enable contribution and interoperability with equipment databases, both institutional and cross-sector.&nbsp; Adoption of the UNIQUIP data publishing specification in asset systems or related views, along with appropriate Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), will open up greater opportunities for efficiency in asset management relating to research equipment. These improvements will enable interoperability with other systems providing greater ownership of the data throughout the process and encourage contribution to quality from the academic community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a great deal of activity and technology entering this new landscape in HE helping to establish early standards development:-</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		equipment.data is supporting efforts to standardise the way data is discovered and the vocabulary used through the application of linked open data techniques.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
		Jisc are exploring the application of new standardised approaches to vocabularies with a <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/programmes/di_researchmanagement/researchinformation/casraipilot.aspx">pilot project</a> working with CASRAI.</li>
	<li>
		Publishing equipment data to the web through an API, or enabling interoperability with an equipment database e.g. Kit Catalogue will allow the linking of equipment data with publications, a means for demonstrating impact of equipment, and by using standard vocabularies will enable aggregated reporting with other datasets.</li>
</ul>
<p>The adoption of standardised vocabulary and data discovery technology has already enabled data aggregation across institutions supporting regional consortia research equipment search capabilities and contribution to equipment.data.</p>
