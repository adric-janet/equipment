<h3>The kit catalogue pilot</h3>
<img src="/resources/newsletters/issue6/kitcatalogue_logo2.png" width="175">
<p>Research intensive universities have state-of-the-art equipment available for use across HE, the wider research community and industry &ndash; from anechoic chambers to wind tunnels, mass spectrometers to supercomputers. This collaboration can help to reduce costs and enable institutions to tap into relevant staff expertise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kit-Catalogue is an open source online system that can help any organisation effectively catalogue, record and locate their kit. This might be laboratory equipment, workshop machines, ICT and specialist tools. Kit-Catalogue can contain a wealth of information on each item including its; specification, custodian, location, handbook, access requirements, usage data and photos. Kit-Catalogue can then enable the sharing of the items by publishing them or exposing the data via an API allowing <a href="http://equipment.data.ac.uk">equipment.data</a>, the &ldquo;National Equipment Portal&rdquo;, to harvest these items.</p>
<p>JISC has supported a <a href="http://www.kit-catalogue.com/projectpages/community/jisc-pilot/" target="_blank">2 year pilot project</a> to look into providing Kit-Catalogue as a hosted service for 10 Institutions.</p>
<p>The pilot will explore if Kit-Catalogue can:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Make it easier for institutions to achieve efficiency savings through sharing facilities</li>
	<li>
		Deliver demonstrable progress against the <a href="http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/">Research Council UK&#39;s (RCUK)</a> strategic goals in this area</li>
	<li>
		Stimulate and facilitate new collaborations, both within HE and with industry.</li>
</ul>
<p>In doing so pilot member institutions will be expected to be:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Committing resource to ensure significant proportion of high value equipment recorded in Kit-Catalogue (e.g. items costing &pound;25K or above)</li>
	<li>
		Making all (or a meaningful subset) of catalogue records available as publicly available information enabling harvesting by the national equipment portal</li>
	<li>
		Contributing material towards a case study of their use of<br />
		Kit-Catalogue</li>
</ul>
<p>The Equipment.data project will be supporting all the pilot institutions in enabling their published data to provide a sustainable and autodiscoverable contribution to the portal through the creation of <a href="http://opd.data.ac.uk">an OPD (Organisational Profile Document)</a></p>
<p>Pilot member institutions:</p>

	<li>
		Aston University</li>
	<li>
		University of Birmingham</li>
	<li>
		De Montfort University</li>
	<li>
		Loughborough University</li>
	<li>
		Newcastle University</li>
	<li>
		Northumbria University</li>
