<p>Publishing your research equipment onto equipment.data is actually much easier than you may think.&nbsp; The benefits of having your equipment published to UNIQUIP guidelines and the ability to search other institutions equipment are endless.&nbsp; The quicker you do this the easier it will be for you as we currently have extra support to help you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please remember to get started all you need is selected equipment items data collated to the UNIQUIP data publishing specification standard and an Organisation Profile Document (OPD) and we collect the data that you publish.&nbsp; It will be auto-discoverable so as you add further data it will automatically go straight onto equipment.data!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just follow these <strong>four</strong> easy steps:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Decide how you are going to publish the data via:</p>
<p style="margin-left:72.0pt;">a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A spreadsheet (can be excel, just needs to follow UNIQUIP headings)</p>
<p style="margin-left:72.0pt;">b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An extract from your database (again just needs to follow UNIQUIP headings)</p>
<p style="margin-left:72.0pt;">c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kit Catalogue</p>
<p style="margin-left:72.0pt;">d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PURE equipment module</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where you are going to publish it:</p>
<p style="margin-left:72.0pt;">a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On your website</p>
<p style="margin-left:72.0pt;">b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On an orphan page of your website (not password protected)</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Create an Organisation Profile Document (OPD) <em>[link to OPD instructions] </em>This tells us about your organisation and the datasets you are publishing &ndash; this could take only 30 minutes!</p>
<p><em>4.</em>Get your OPD linked from your homepage (you will probably need your marketing and IT&rsquo;s support with this) All you need is this simple hidden (machine readable) link in your home page header:&nbsp; &lt;link rel=&quot;openorg&quot; href=&quot;http://www.example.ac.uk/profile.ttl&quot; /&gt;</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s it! You are now a contributor to equipment.data &ndash; welcome on board!</p>
