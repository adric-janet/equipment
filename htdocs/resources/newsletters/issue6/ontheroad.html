<h4>BUFDG, 21<sup>st</sup> Century Finance Systems &ndash; 24 September</h4>
<p>It was an interesting event for the project to attend, both in new contacts established and advancing existing, although it was also interesting to hear about asset management and the relationship with the equipment sharing agenda. We posed an audience participation poll question and were intrigued by the result&hellip;..</p>

<p>Interestingly Unit4&rsquo;s Agresso finance solution is used by 42% of the 56 institutions represented.&nbsp; Unit4 are one finance solution vendor keen to roll out a solution enabling direct publishing of selected assets to equipment.data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h4>
	UCISA CISG14 Conference &ndash; 12-14 Nov</h4>
<p>This event focussed on the emerging challenges in the Higher Education IT landscape and the need to respond to new thinking in IT strategy e.g. greater use of enterprise architecture and increased demand for interoperability and efficiency in data management.&nbsp; It was interesting from our perspective to note areas where Linked open data can play a role and indeed where it is already being considered.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>
	Kit catalogue user group meeting &ndash; 17 Nov</h4>
<p>We attended the user group to support the launch of the pilot and discuss how we can support the project in advancing the equipment sharing agenda. Support will initially be available for the 11 participating institutions in establishing their contribution to equipment.data.</p>
<h4>
	Keynote seminar: Improving finances and efficiency in HE &ndash; 19 Nov</h4>
<p>An interesting highlight from this seminar was a number of speakers talking about the changes we can explore in estates management to achieve efficiency savings, many of which echoed my article in the July edition of this newsletter.&nbsp; Estates management will clearly play an important role in enabling efficiencies through design and refurbishment of our estates infrastructure.&nbsp; This also poses the challenge of introducing effective data management to benchmark such savings. A future link up with our <a href="http://www.hefce.ac.uk/whatwedo/lgm/sd/carbon/">Carbon Reduction Strategies</a> perhaps?&nbsp;</p>
<h4>
	Casrai Canada ReConnect 14 &ndash; 19-21 Nov</h4>
<p>equipment.data were a sponsor at this landmark data management event.&nbsp; Our information stand received considerable interest with the project receiving a mention in the plenary sessions.&nbsp; Positive feedback was received from the event organiser along with new interest stimulated from US institutions.</p>
<h4>
	DCC 2<sup>nd</sup> Data Management Workshop, Cologne &ndash; 28-29 Nov</h4>
<p>We presented a well-received poster highlighting data discovery advancement achieved through the equipment.data project.&nbsp; This was supported by an <a href="http://www.tr32db.uni-koeln.de/workshops/poster.php?wsID=4">academic abstract</a> discussing linked open data.&nbsp;</p>
