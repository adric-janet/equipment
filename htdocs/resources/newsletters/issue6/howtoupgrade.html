<h3>How to make your equipment data fully autodiscoverable</h3>
<img src="/resources/newsletters/issue6/network11.jpg" width="175">
<p>Are you contributing to equipment.data but not yet Gold compliant? Now that equipment.data is reaching the end of its development period we need to ensure institutional contributions are fully sustainable. The key to this is autodiscovery using the <a href="http://equipment.data.ac.uk/compliance">OPD (Organisation Profile Document) </a><br />
	<br />
	The OPD is a small machine-readable file that describes the Institution (including full name, logo, location) and lists available datasets, in this case your equipment dataset. The importance of the OPD is that should any of your information change and need to be updated it will done by the contributing institution. equipment.data will then simply update the information in the next scheduled scan of the OPD.<br />
	<br />
	Whilst the OPD reduces the staff commitment from equipment.data, the location of the OPDs still require curation by our team. The way to avoid this is to make your OPD and dataset autodiscoverable and this is done by linking the OPD from your home page. As part of equipment.data&rsquo;s ingest process every university home page is checked for the hidden link to the OPD and therefore finding all the available equipment datasets to be harvested into the equipment.data portal.<br />
	<br />
	We would really like to hear from you if you are interested in upgrading your feed to Gold, we are currently resourced by EPSRC to assist achieving a sustainable level of contribution to the service, so please get in touch either contacting our support team at support@data.ac.uk or call 023 8059 9304.<br />
