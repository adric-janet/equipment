<h2><img src="/resources/images/gongs/equipment-data-bronze-60.png" style="float: right;"/>Bronze contributor: Public data in a conforming format</h2>

<p>This is the minimum level for your data to be included in equipment.data.ac.uk. You must provide your equipment data in one of the accepted formats (Uniquip spreadsheet in Excel, or CSV, PURE XML, RDF Conforming to Openorg pattern, RDF Conforming to N8 pattern, JSON from Kitcat. You must have also provided contact information for corrections to the dataset and the name and homepage of the organisation this equipment is associated with.</p>

<p>This puts some work on equipment.data staff and while we can cope in the short term, it is not practical for us to plan to keep 150-200 records up-to-date in the long term, hence we aim for most sites to provide this information in a way we can use automatically without emails.</p>

<p>In addition to the basic bronze requirements, your organisation also provides a valid Organisation Profile Document, linking to the equipment dataset for your organisation and providing information on your organisation's homepage, logo, and corrections information for the equipment dataset.</p>

<p>This provides you with a way to easily keep the metadata about your organisation and dataset correct without a human having to process every request.</p>

<p>To conform to our gold standard, two additional steps are required.</p>

<p>Your OPD should provide a licence for the OPD itself, and a license for your equipment data (these may be different). Our preferered license is CC0 - which allows everybody to use and republish your data with confidence. However, ODCA (which requires you are credited any time anybody uses any part of the data) or OGL (designed for UK public sector) are both also acceptable. Other compatible licenses are NOT acceptible as we wish to minimise the number of liceses a user of the combined data needs to contend with.</p>

<p>The other requirement is that your OPD can be automatically discovered from your homepage. Either via <u>http://www.YOURUNI.ac.uk/.well-known/openorg</u> or via a hidden and explicit link in your organisation's homepage. This allows us and everybody else to know with a degree of confidence that your OPD, and therefore your equipment data, is officially sanctioned by your organisation.</p>
