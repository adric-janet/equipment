<h2>About this Site</h2>
<p>
Development of equipment.data.ac.uk is funded by <a href="http://www.epsrc.ac.uk">EPSRC</a> in response to the need to improve the visibility and enable the equipment sharing discussion among UK universities. The project is supported by <a href='http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/Pages/Home.aspx'>RCUK</a> with the aim to deliver a national "shop window" for research equipment - enabling searching across UK HE equipment datasets.</p>

<p>Along with this UK HE equipment search portal, the project team can provide technical support and guidance to institutions in the process of establishing their equipment dataset and publishing. The project the team is also exploring the benefits of open data publishing with the Open Data Institute and the Gateway to Research project, linking wider datasets to increase data richness. If you would like technical advice with the publishing of your equipment dataset to enable its discovery by this search function please use the <a href='http://dev.data.ac.uk/get-in-touch/'>contact form</a>.

<p>If you would like to contribute your equipment and facilities data to this dataset, please see our <a href='/faq'>detailed publishing specification</a>.</p>
